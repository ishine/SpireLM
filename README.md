# SpireLM
Spire is a 7B parameter decoder-only model with strong abilities in machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech translation. [SpireBase](https://huggingface.co/utter-project/SpireBase) was created by applying speech-centric continued pretraining to [TowerBase-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/TowerBase-7B-v0.1), which was itself created by applying continued pretraining to [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b).

## Model Checkpoints
We release our checkpoints through Hugging Face. All of our models can be loaded as `LlamaForCausalLM` instances, allowing inference to be performed with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). For further details on the models, check [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10620).

## Tokenizing Speech
The core of our approach to speech is *discretization* - continuous speech signals are converted into sequences of tokens, which can then be processed alongside text.
